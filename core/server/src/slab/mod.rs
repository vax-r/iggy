// General rules how to implement `with_*` methods on any slab"
// 1. When implementing method that accepts closure f, make sure that the caller can supply closure only with 1 depth of callbacks.
// for example, observe following code snippet:
// ```rust
// let topic_id = self.streams2.with_topic_by_id(stream_id, topic_id, get_topic_id());
// ```
// if we would not provide a `with_topic_by_id` method and purely relied only ony `with_topics`, we would have to write:
// ```rust
// let topic_id = self.streams2.with_topics(stream_id, get_topic_by_id(topic_id, get_topic_id())); // `get_topic_id` is a closure that retrieves the topic id.
// ```
// we need to supply a nested closure to `get_topic_by_id`.
